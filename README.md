Make a new web api project in Visual Studio Code and create a new controller with the name BestTAsController.


Create these endpoints:

Create an endpoint called AddTwoNumbers and pass in two variables using the route.
In AddTwoNumbers, take in the variables from the route, add them together, and return the sum.
Create an endpoint called ReverseIt and let it pass in 1 variable using the route.
In ReverseIt, take in the variable from the route, reverse it, and return the solution.
Create an endpoint called SayHello, and let it pass in 1 variable using the route.
In SayHello, take in the variable from the route, and return hello + variable.
Create another endpoint called SayHelloTwo.
Instead of just using a variable in the route, use a "model" to enter in the name.
Hint: (new folder/ file, get and set, constructor).

I can't get the dotnet watch run to work, I asked Jacob but all he told me to do was read the error and that didnt help at all.
